3D Print geographical features in norway with .stl generation

## Description
Use several APIs to fetch data based on simple user input to create a user-customizable product, in this case a 3D-print ready .stl file.

### Quick-start
- Create a Python3 virtualenv to match `dependencies.txt`

- Run `app.py` and follow the promps

The current and planned endpoint of this project is a generated `.stl` file matching the geographical features of the location name provided by the user and fetched from live data using several APIs.
